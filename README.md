## üìñ Overview

**flaws.cloud** is an interactive challenge platform that simulates common AWS misconfigurations across services like S3, IAM, EC2, and EBS. I completed all 6 levels of this challenge using AWS CLI, Kali Linux (via Parallels VM), and a free-tier AWS account.

Each level reflects a real-world attack scenario, and I documented how I approached the problem, the vulnerabilities I found, challenges faced, and how such flaws can be mitigated in production environments.

This report includes a walkthrough of each level, lessons learned, and screenshots as proof of concept.

- **curl**: For SSRF and metadata testing
- **Browser**: For URL-based file discovery
- **Git**: For analyzing version control history

## üìÅ Challenge Levels

---

## ü™£ Level 1: Public S3 Bucket Enumeration

**Objective**: Enumerate and access content from a publicly exposed S3 bucket.

**Approach**:  
I started with domain enumeration using basic networking commands and identified the S3 bucket region. After attempting regular S3 CLI access and getting denied, I used the `--no-sign-request` flag to bypass credential checks. This successfully listed the contents of the public bucket.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f572f206-039b-46ad-ab7e-d78db62883ee)


**Lessons Learned**:
- Public S3 buckets with ‚ÄúList‚Äù permissions are easily accessible.
- Anonymous users can extract sensitive files if misconfigured.

**Remediation**:
- Block all public access to S3.
- Implement the principle of least privilege.

## üîì Level 2: Authenticated User Access

**Objective**: Access a bucket configured for "any authenticated AWS user".
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c55e8d5a-d218-4770-bbdd-590fa32decfb)

**Approach**:  
I created a low-permission IAM user in my own AWS account. Using this IAM user‚Äôs credentials, I was able to access the bucket, since AWS treats *any authenticated user* across any AWS account as valid.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f63a7a5b-b1fc-4aa1-a312-ad0a891b2c99)

**Lessons Learned**:
- AWS allows cross-account access if a bucket policy permits "AuthenticatedUsers".
- This mistake is common in dev/staging environments.

**Remediation**:
- Use specific AWS account IDs or user ARNs in bucket policies.
- Never use `"Principal": "*"` for internal services.

## üïµÔ∏è Level 3: Git Credentials Leak

**Objective**: Discover leaked AWS credentials in Git commit history.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc59e834-9143-4b4d-81d2-795d4f60d78b)


**Approach**:  
I synced the bucket locally and discovered a hidden `.git` directory. I inspected the Git log and checked out an older commit that contained plaintext AWS credentials in a file named `access_keys.txt`. I used these credentials to access new buckets.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43706fda-fbd0-47d8-9542-895662888596)

**Lessons Learned**:
- Committing secrets to version control can result in full compromise.
- Even deleted credentials remain in Git history.

**Remediation**:
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files.
- Scan repos with tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog`.
- Rotate access keys frequently.

## üíΩ Level 4: Unencrypted EBS Snapshot Exploitation

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8419a75-20fb-4b24-a8a0-dfe4e42e3e9b)

**Objective**: Mount a public EBS snapshot and extract login credentials.

**Approach**:  
I listed publicly available EBS snapshots and created a volume from one of them in my AWS account. I launched an EC2 instance, attached the volume, and SSH‚Äôd into the instance. After mounting the volume, I navigated to the user‚Äôs home directory and found a script file containing the EC2 credentials.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92bec151-324a-4eed-9076-43c6eba6fed3)

**Lessons Learned**:
- Public and unencrypted snapshots can be used to reconstruct entire systems.
- Sensitive data like passwords and configs can easily be extracted.

**Remediation**:
- Encrypt EBS snapshots and volumes.
- Remove unnecessary snapshot sharing.
- Avoid storing credentials in plain text on disk.

## üåê Level 5: Metadata Service Exploitation (SSRF)

**Objective**: Exploit a proxy that accesses the EC2 metadata API.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4028156d-f041-4beb-91cf-30ba55e8da32)

**Approach**:  
I used the provided domain to access `169.254.169.254` through a vulnerable proxy. This gave me temporary credentials for a high-privilege IAM role. I configured these credentials in AWS CLI and used them to list the next bucket.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cb9c258-ead3-46a9-afbb-8cc981461884)

**Lessons Learned**:
- IMDSv1 is vulnerable to SSRF attacks.
- Attackers can steal temporary credentials via web app bugs.

**Remediation**:
- Enforce IMDSv2 on all instances.
- Protect metadata IP via firewall/security group rules.
- Never expose internal URLs to external users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Level 6: IAM Policy Misconfiguration

**Objective**: Abuse over-permissive IAM policies to discover and invoke hidden Lambda functions.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8eacffd-9759-45e0-b40a-d4a2e7022021)

**Approach**:  
I enumerated attached policies and noticed that the `SecurityAudit` policy was attached to the IAM user. This allowed me to list all Lambda functions and associated API Gateways. Using the discovered endpoint, I invoked the function and completed the challenge.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc6a599c-a2e1-4617-94fe-ad4eac41ba15)


**Lessons Learned**:
- Overly broad IAM permissions expose critical infrastructure.
- AWS managed policies like `SecurityAudit` should not be used by regular users.

**Remediation**:
- Follow the principle of least privilege.
- Use scoped, custom IAM policies.
- Audit IAM roles and attached policies regularly.
